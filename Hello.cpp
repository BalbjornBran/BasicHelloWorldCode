    Hello.cpp is a basic program as an entry point for learning c++, 
    we're gonna be learnig how to print strings, inside the main function using the C standar I-O library. 
    We're gonna be using single and multi-line comments to organize the code.
*/

//First, we have to define the libraries that we are going to use in the program to be able to access its functions.
#include <cstdio>

//And to start, we need the main function, which is the following:
int main()
{

    // We call the printf function available in the c standard library I.O.(Input, Output) to display a message on the screen
    printf("Hello, my name is Balbjorn.\n");
    // We can use the character \n to jump to a different line 
    printf("This file is ready to run.\n");
    
}
